Lesson 2: Convolutional Neural Networks

Theory: Introduction to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their use in image recognition tasks. Building blocks of CNNs: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers
Hands-on: Implement a simple CNN architecture using a deep learning framework and train it on a more challenging image classification task such as CIFAR-10. Discuss the role of each building block in the architecture and how to design an effective architecture for a given task. Also, introduce techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning to improve performance.
