Lesson 1: Introduction to Deep Learning

Theory: Overview of deep learning and its applications. Basic concepts: linear regression, softmax regression, and multilayer perceptrons
Hands-on: Implement a simple multilayer perceptron using a deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, and train it on a simple classification task such as the MNIST dataset. In addition to coding, discuss the intuition behind each step of the process, including the role of activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.
