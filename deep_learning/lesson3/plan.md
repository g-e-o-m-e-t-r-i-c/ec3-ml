Lesson 3: Recurrent Neural Networks

Theory: Introduction to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their use in sequence processing tasks. Building blocks of RNNs: recurrent layers, gated recurrent units (GRUs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) units
Hands-on: Implement a simple RNN architecture using a deep learning framework and train it on a text classification task such as sentiment analysis of movie reviews. Discuss the intuition behind each building block in the architecture and the challenges of training RNNs. Also, introduce techniques such as attention and bidirectional RNNs to improve performance.
